  This function determines if there are at least 'x' overlapping numbers between two ranges.

  Args:
    arr: An array containing five integers: [a, b, c, d, x]
         where:
           - a, b: Define the first range (inclusive)
           - c, d: Define the second range (inclusive)
           - x: The minimum number of overlapping values

  Returns:
    "true" if there are at least 'x' overlapping numbers, "false" otherwise.
